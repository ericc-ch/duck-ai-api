# Copilot API

## Warning

As of 3 Mar 2025, after around 1 month of usage, GitHub finally sends me the first warning email:

I think the reason could be due to the following:

- The spoofing wasn't enough. Just faking a few headers maybe just wasn't enough. There were also some sort of machine and session id that I wasn't able to replicate. I mostly suspect these headers are used for telemetry.
- I use `aider` mostly using `architect` mode, which leads to increased calls to the API. This is the most likely culprit
- I also used the API with PageAssist as a replacement for ChatGPT/Claude. The topics are often not related to coding, and GitHub could be flagging these. Though I doubt they check every single prompt that's coming in.

So, for now I'll be stopping working on this project. I know this project is nothing compared to other, big, and actually legal open source projects, but I still want to thank everyone that uses this project and helped me work on it.

This is the repo that earned me my first Starstruck badge, so it has a special place in my heart.

Now back to rawdogging projects without AI. Cheers!

⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY** ⚠️
This project is a reverse-engineered implementation of the GitHub Copilot API created for educational purposes only. It is not officially supported by GitHub and should not be used in production environments.

## Project Overview

A wrapper around GitHub Copilot API to make it OpenAI compatible, making it usable for other tools.

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7654b383-669d-4eb9-b23c-06d7aefee8c5

## Prerequisites

- Bun (>= 1.2.x)
- GitHub account with Copilot Individual subscription

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```sh
bun install
```

## Using with npx

You can run the project directly using npx:

```sh
npx duck-ai-api@latest
```

With options:

```sh
npx duck-ai-api --port 8080
```

## Running from Source

The project can be run from source in several ways:

### Development Mode

```sh
bun run dev
```

Starts the server with hot reloading enabled, which automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected. This is ideal for development.

### Production Mode

```sh
bun run start
```

Runs the server in production mode with hot reloading disabled. Use this for deployment or production environments.

### Command Line Options

The server accepts several command line options:

| Option        | Description                          | Default |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| --port, -p    | Port to listen on                    | 4141    |
| --verbose, -v | Enable verbose logging               | false   |
| --log-file    | File to log request/response details | -       |

Note: The `--help, -h` option is automatically available through the underlying command-line framework.

Example with options:

```sh
bun run start --port 8080 --verbose
```

In all cases, the server will start and listen for API requests on the specified port.

## Tested Tools Compatibility

| Tool                                                             | Status | Notes                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)                       | Full   | Fully compatible                                                      |
| [bolt.diy](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy)          | Full   | Fully compatible; use any random API key in UI if models fail to load |
| [Page Assist](https://github.com/n4ze3m/page-assist)             | Full   | Fully compatible                                                      |
| [Kobold AI Lite](https://github.com/LostRuins/lite.koboldai.net) | Full   | Fully compatible                                                      |

**Note:** In general, any application that uses the standard OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` and `/models` endpoints should work with this API.

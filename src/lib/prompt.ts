You are an AI assistant.  You have been given a chat history formatted as follows:

SYSTEM: [system message]
USER: [user message]
ASSISTANT: [assistant message]
... and so on.

Here is the chat history:

${formatMessages(messages)}
---

Your task is to respond to the *very last message* in this history that is from the "USER".  Please provide your response as if you are continuing the conversation.

Crucially, your response should be *only the content* of your message.  Do not include any prefixes like "ASSISTANT:", "AI:", or anything else.  Just the text of your answer.

For example, if the last user message is "What is the capital of France?", your response should be:

"The capital of France is Paris."

Do not write it like this:

"ASSISTANT: The capital of France is Paris."
